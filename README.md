# PHP Data Structures Showcase

This is a PHP project showcasing my progress in learning data structures. The project includes implementation of various data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees and graphs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have PHP installed on your machine. You can download PHP from the official website: [https://www.php.net/downloads.php](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/idoko-emmanuel/Data-Structure.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
cd Data-Structure


## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the project directory and run any of the PHP files using the command line. For example, to run the `LinkedList.php` file, you can use the following command:
php LinkedList.php

This will execute the PHP file and output the results in the command line.

## Data Structures

The following data structures have been implemented in this project:

- Arrays (`arrays.php`)
- Stacks (`stacks.php`)
- Queues (`queues.php`)
- Linked Lists (`linked-lists.php`)
- Trees (`trees.php`)
- Graphs (`graphs.php`)

Each file contains implementation of the corresponding data structure along with sample usage.
